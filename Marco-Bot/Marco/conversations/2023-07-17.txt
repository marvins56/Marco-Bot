The SQL query SELECT `bookingLink` FROM items WHERE name = 'Organizado por Cali Cultural'; did not return any results. Additionally, the beta_users table does not contain any booking links for the event either, as the upvotes, downvotes, addedItems, rsvp, Last Modified, towns, and sponsors columns do not contain any booking links for the event "Salsa en la Calle del Sabor,Tour de Comida Callejera Caleña y Valluna (Organizado por Cali Cultural)" or "Un Borondo por Cali (Organizado por El Traveler)" or "Cali collaborative Thursdays MeetUp (West-center)". Therefore, there is no link for the event "Organizado por Cali Cultural" in the items table.

No events are scheduled for tomorrow based on the SQL query provided and the new context. The beta_users table does not contain any events for tomorrow, as indicated by the empty SQLResult and the lack of events listed in the towns column. The new context does not contain any events for tomorrow either, as the events listed are for dates in June, July, and August of 2023, and the filters table does not contain any events for tomorrow either.
